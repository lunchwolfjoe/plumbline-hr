                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Amazon's hourly wage spend increased by $9.3B between 2020-2022, with pay codes growing from 130 to 178, creating systematic inefficiencies across the network.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Innovation:</strong> Rather than traditional cost-cutting, I developed a comprehensive fraud, waste, and abuse framework that identified systematic issues across $700M in annual expenses.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Results:</strong> $100M annual reduction opportunity identified and validated, with systematic policy modifications to reduce risk and eliminate waste.</p>

                <h3>The Strategic Challenge</h3>
                <p>The compensation complexity crisis created systematic breakdowns in governance that threatened both financial performance and regulatory compliance while creating inequitable associate experiences.</p>
                
                <h3>My OCEANS-CARGO Methodology</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology-Enabled Fraud:</strong> Multiple bereavement requests for the same day with different hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Process Inefficiencies:</strong> Delayed payroll processing in California creating penalty payments</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Gap Analysis:</strong> Inconsistent interpretation of compensation policies across locations</li>

                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Amazon's senior business leaders supported shift differential standardization in principle, but "differing opinions on foundational features" created executive deadlock affecting hundreds of thousands of associates.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> Led systematic executive alignment process transforming controversial policy disagreements into unified strategic direction.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Achieved 19.8% cost reduction through employee class standardization, delivering $696K annual savings per site.</p>

                <h3>The Alignment Crisis</h3>
                <p>Multiple business units with conflicting approaches to shift differential compensation created systematic misalignment that prevented effective decision-making and created operational disadvantages.</p>

                <h3>My Strategic Framework Development</h3>

                    <li><strong>Issue Framing:</strong> Clearly separated in-scope decisions from implementation details</li>

                <h3>My Key Innovations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Desirability" Framework:</strong> Replaced "burden" terminology to reframe conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Analyzed 92% of companies offering shift differentials</li>
                    <li><strong>Executive Facilitation:</strong> Transformed months of debate into weeks of structured process</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Standardization:</strong> Consistent framework across GCF, GDS, ATS, and GSF business units</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Quantified Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> 19.8% through employee class standardization (SLC1 demonstration)</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Savings:</strong> $696K per site through policy optimization</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Savings:</strong> 5.7% through new shift pattern flexibility</li>
