                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Amazon's hourly wage spend increased by $9.3 billion between 2020 and 2022, while pay codes proliferated from 130 to 178, creating systematic inefficiencies and compliance risks across a complex compensation structure affecting hundreds of thousands of associates.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Innovation:</strong> Developed OCEANS-CARGO framework analyzing fraud, waste, and abuse across $700 million in annual expenses.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Identified $100 million in annual cost reduction opportunities through systematic policy modifications, technology improvements, and process redesigns.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Strategic Challenge</h3>
                <p>The compensation complexity crisis created systematic breakdowns in governance that threatened both financial performance and regulatory compliance while creating inequitable associate experiences.</p>
                
                <h3>My OCEANS-CARGO Methodology</h3>

                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Amazon's fulfillment network faced increasing operational complexity due to elevated containerization, shorter delivery times, and the shift of sort center workload to fulfillment centers.</p>

            <h2>Executive Alignment: My Leadership of Controversial Policy Decisions</h2>
            <div class="case-study-content">
                <div class="case-study-highlight">
                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Amazon's senior business leaders supported shift differential standardization in principle, but "differing opinions on foundational features" created executive deadlock affecting hundreds of thousands of associates.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> Led systematic executive alignment process transforming controversial policy disagreements into unified strategic direction.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Achieved 19.8% cost reduction through employee class standardization, delivering $696K annual savings per site.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Alignment Crisis</h3>
                <p>Multiple business units with conflicting approaches to shift differential compensation created systematic misalignment that prevented effective decision-making and created operational disadvantages.</p>

                <h3>My Strategic Framework Development</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue Framing:</strong> Clearly separated in-scope decisions from implementation details</li>

                    <li><strong>Executive Facilitation:</strong> Transformed months of debate into weeks of structured process</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Standardization:</strong> Consistent framework across GCF, GDS, ATS, and GSF business units</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Quantified Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> 19.8% through employee class standardization (SLC1 demonstration)</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Savings:</strong> $696K per site through policy optimization</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Savings:</strong> 5.7% through new shift pattern flexibility</li>
