# Case Study: The $100M Cost Optimization - Eliminating Fraud, Waste, and Abuse at Scale

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge:** Amazon's hourly wage spend increased by $9.3 billion between 2020 and 2022, while pay codes proliferated from 130 to 178, creating systematic inefficiencies and compliance risks across a complex compensation structure affecting hundreds of thousands of associates.

**The Strategic Approach:** Rather than traditional cost-cutting measures, I developed a comprehensive fraud, waste, and abuse framework that identified systematic issues across $700 million in annual expenses, focusing on six critical pay codes/programs.

**The Results:** Identified $100 million in annual cost reduction opportunities through systematic policy modifications, technology improvements, and process redesigns - all while maintaining competitive positioning and improving associate experience.

## The Strategic Challenge

### The Compensation Complexity Crisis

**The Scale of the Problem:**
- **$9.3 billion increase** in hourly wage spend over two years (2020-2022)
- **Pay code proliferation** from 130 to 178 different compensation categories
- **$700 million annual expense** across six critical pay programs
- **Hundreds of locations** with inconsistent policy interpretation and application

**Systemic Issues Identified:**
- **Fraud:** Associates receiving improper payments through system manipulation
- **Waste:** Unnecessary expenses from inefficient processes and delayed compliance
- **Abuse:** Policy gaps allowing unintended compensation outcomes
- **Complexity:** Administrative burden reducing operational efficiency

**The Strategic Context:**
This wasn't just a cost problem - it was a **systematic breakdown** in compensation governance that threatened both financial performance and regulatory compliance while creating inequitable associate experiences.

### Why Traditional Cost Management Failed

**Previous Approaches Attempted:**
- Budget controls and spending limits
- Manager training and accountability measures
- Audit programs and compliance monitoring
- Technology patches for specific issues

**Why They Were Insufficient:**
- **Addressed symptoms, not root causes** of systematic inefficiencies
- **Reactive rather than proactive** approach to cost management
- **Fragmented solutions** that didn't address interconnected issues
- **Lacked comprehensive framework** for identifying and eliminating waste

**The Strategic Insight:**
The problem required **systematic analysis and redesign** of the entire compensation structure, not incremental improvements to existing processes.
