            <h2>Nick Plumb: Architect of HR Excellence</h2>
            <p>Nick Plumb is not your average HR consultant—he’s a strategic innovator who redefined compensation and operations at Amazon, one of the world’s most complex organizations. With 15+ years spanning HR analytics, product management, and operational leadership, Nick has a singular track record: saving $1.4 billion in FWA, overseeing a $60 billion workforce budget, and driving $200 million in savings through predictive pilots. His work at Amazon didn’t just optimize—it transformed.</p>
            <p>At Plumbline HR, Nick distills this expertise into fractional CPO services that deliver enterprise-grade results for mid-sized firms. Why $7,500/month? Because his data-driven methodologies—honed at the nexus of tech, logistics, and human capital—routinely generate seven-figure impacts. From machine learning insights to operational turnarounds, Nick’s approach is why clients see him as a C-suite necessity, not an expense.</p>
